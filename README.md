Hi there!

I was writing JavaScripts before it was cool. I used (and teached) Node.js before it reached v1.0.

Recently I started to contribute to [Deno](https://deno.land), especially improving the compatibility layer with Node.js.

I'm looking for job offers in Budapest or to work completely remotely.

Fun fact: Throughout the years I was experiencing with a lot of languages, technologies and frameworks. For example I wrote a Core Graphics like [framework](/nannys) for a tiny microcontroller. And a [firmware](/wiframe) for a WiFi-connected, cloud powered, e-ink display.
