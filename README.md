Hi there!

I was writing JavaScripts before it was cool. I used (and teached) Node.js before it reached v1.0.
My career path is a little bit uncommon. After working for brands like BMW, Lâ€™OrÃ©al, Bacardi, Milumil and Fressnapf, I had my own way in my life. In the past two years I made frozen pizzas. ðŸ˜€
Now I'm trying to return to my profession.

Currently I'm unemployed but trying to return to my profession. Right now my focus is to contribute to [Deno](https://deno.land), especially improving the compatibility layer with Node.js. I think it's a topic that's hot enough to ask for your support.

I'm looking for funding to let me able to pay my bills.
I'm also looking for job offers in the area of Amsterdam or to work completely remotely.

So please, if you can help me reach my dreams then support me!

Fun fact: Throughout the years I was experiencing with a lot of languages, technologies and frameworks. For example I wrote a Core Graphics like [framework](/nannys) for a tiny microcontroller. On a 128x32px monochrome display. With built-in support for tweening and even [timeline easing functions](https://easings.net/). Written in C/C++. And a [firmware](/wiframe) for a WiFi-connected, cloud powered, e-ink display.
