Hi there!

I beginned making software as a teenager with [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) and can't stop since then. I was writing JavaScripts before it was cool, started using TypeScript when it was beta, used (and teached) Node.js before it reached v1.0, but I'm still enthusiastic about the JS world and the speed of its evolution. 
Recently started to [contribute](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aschwarzkopfb+is%3Aclosed) to [Deno](https://deno.land) and [it's standard library](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aschwarzkopfb+is%3Aclosed), especially improving the compatibility layer with Node.js.
Currently I'm working on growth & monetization experiments in full-stack at [Prezi](https://prezi.com).

Throughout the years I was experiencing with a lot of languages, technologies and frameworks. For example I wrote an Apple Core Graphics like [framework](/nannys) for a tiny microcontroller. And a [firmware](/wiframe) for a WiFi-connected, cloud powered, e-ink display.
