Hi there!

I was writing JavaScripts before it was cool. I used (and teached) Node.js before it reached v1.0.
My career path is a little bit uncommon. After working for brands like BMW, Lâ€™OrÃ©al, Bacardi, Milumil and Fressnapf, I had my own way in my life. In the past two years I made frozen pizzas. ðŸ˜€ Now I'm going to return to my profession.

Recently I started to contribute to [Deno](https://deno.land), especially improving the compatibility layer with Node.js.

I'm looking for job offers in the area of Amsterdam or to work completely remotely.

Fun fact: Throughout the years I was experiencing with a lot of languages, technologies and frameworks. For example I wrote a Core Graphics like [framework](/nannys) for a tiny microcontroller. And a [firmware](/wiframe) for a WiFi-connected, cloud powered, e-ink display.
